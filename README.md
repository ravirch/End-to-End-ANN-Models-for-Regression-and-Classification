# End-to-End Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Project for Regression and Classification

This project demonstrates the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to solve both regression and classification problems. Drawing inspiration from Krish Naik's Udemy course on Generative AI, it covers a complete workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and prediction, all implemented in Jupyter notebooks and a Streamlit app for easy interaction.

## Project Overview
This project includes separate ANN models for handling regression and classification tasks, providing an end-to-end solution from data preprocessing to model prediction. It also includes hyperparameter tuning, logging, and a simple web app interface using Streamlit for showcasing predictions. By working with both types of models, the project illustrates how ANNs can be adapted to various data types and objectives.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:

- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

All required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravirch/End-to-End-ANN-Models-for-Regression-and-Classification
   cd End-to-End-ANN-Models-for-Regression-and-Classification
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Notebooks
- Open `Classification ANN Training.ipynb` and `Regression ANN Training.ipynb` to train the classification and regression models, respectively.
- Use `Hyperparameter Tuning ANN.ipynb` to experiment with different hyperparameter configurations and optimize model performance.
- Use `Prediction Example.ipynb` to test the trained models with sample data for predictions.

### Running the Streamlit App
To start the Streamlit app, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser, providing an interactive interface for testing the classification and regression models.

## Project Notebooks

1. **Classification ANN Training.ipynb**: Notebook dedicated to training a classification model using ANN.
2. **Regression ANN Training.ipynb**: Notebook dedicated to training a regression model using ANN.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning ANN.ipynb**: Explores various hyperparameter options to improve the performance of both models.
4. **Prediction Example.ipynb**: Demonstrates how to use the trained models to make predictions on new data.

## Logging and Checkpoints

- The `logs/` and `regressionlogs/` directories store logs for monitoring training progress.
- `dump/` and `dump_reg/` contain model checkpoints, allowing you to resume training or evaluate saved models without retraining.
