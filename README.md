This project presents an end-to-end approach to building Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for both regression and classification, demonstrating the versatility of neural networks in predictive analytics. Inspired by Krish Naik’s comprehensive Udemy course on Generative AI, this project incorporates key techniques and best practices covered in the course, including data preprocessing, model architecture tuning, and evaluation methods. By implementing two distinct ANN models—one for regression and another for classification—it aims to showcase how ANNs can be adapted for different types of data and objectives. Krish Naik’s insightful explanations on neural network fundamentals and practical implementations have been instrumental in guiding the structure and functionality of this project, making it a practical resource for learners looking to strengthen their skills in both ANN development and applied machine learning. Special acknowledgment is given to Krish Naik for his valuable tutorials, which have greatly enriched the project’s approach and outcomes.
